# Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio built with Next.js (App Router). It includes a modern responsive layout, a polished navigation component, and global design tokens.

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Notes

- Global styles live in `app/globals.css`.
- The navbar component is at `app/components/navbar` and includes a mobile toggle.
- Replace `/favicon.ico` with a project icon for improved presentation.

If you'd like, I can continue: add project pages, a projects listing, or deploy instructions.
